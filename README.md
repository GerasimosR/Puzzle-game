 The puzzle consists of 8 square pieces numbered from 1 to 8. The **"New Game"** button initializes the pieces of the puzzle in random positions and resets the **"Moves"** counter. When the user clicks on a piece that is adjacent to an empty square, this piece moves to the empty space. The **"Moves"** counter counts the shifts that have taken place in the current batch. When the pieces are placed in the correct order, a success message appears.
